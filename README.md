# Battleship in the OOP way


## The story
	The pirate called Jack Crow is looking for somebody to create a program which will help him to train candidates who want to join his crew. Our idea is the Battleship game. 

The object of the Battleship is to try and sink all of the other player's before they sink all of your ships. All of the other player's ships are somewhere on his/her board.  You try and hit them by calling out the coordinates of one of the squares on the board.  The other player also tries to hit your ships by calling out coordinates.  Neither you nor the other player can see the other's board so you must try to guess where they are.
